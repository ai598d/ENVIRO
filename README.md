<h5><center> Freeway Wandarer </center></h5>

# Project Goal

* A wanderer bot that crosses a freeway of moving objects.

* Implement a state machine (see diagram) to acheive above objective.

* Implement multiple moving object(back and fourth) to create freeway.

* Implement a proportional controller to control wandarer direction.

# Key Challenges

* Defining the requirement/architecture of state machine.
    * It's more managable to keep each state for one simple task.
* Trying to implement PID controller. 
    * Adding Integral and derivative terms makes thing more complicated. Out of scope for this project as it becomes for of a control theory problem.
